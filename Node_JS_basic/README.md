# Node_JS_basic

## Project Overview

This project is designed to teach and reinforce fundamental Node.js concepts through a series of progressively challenging exercises. It covers essential topics such as JavaScript execution in Node, file system operations, asynchronous programming, HTTP server creation with both the built-in `http` module and Express framework, and modern JavaScript usage with Babel.

In addition, the project emphasizes best development practices like code linting using ESLint with the Airbnb style guide, automated testing with Jest, and managing dependencies via npm.
